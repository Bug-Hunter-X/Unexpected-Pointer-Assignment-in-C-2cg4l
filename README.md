# Unexpected Pointer Assignment in C

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in C programming involving pointer assignment.  The code modifies a variable indirectly using a pointer, which can be easily overlooked if not carefully considered.

The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.c` file contains the same code with comments explaining the issue and no changes made to the code itself (the bug is educational).
